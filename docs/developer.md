# Developer documentation

This file contains information of use to developers wanting to use Terracotta in
their own projects. The rules and information contained here should serve as a
good baseline for any project, but can be changed as required.

The main sections in this document are:

  - [Getting started](#getting-started)
  - [Codebase structure](#codebase-structure)
  - [API endpoint structure](#api-endpoint-structure)
  - [API endpoint commit checklist](#api-endpoint-commit-checklist)
  - [Coding standards](#coding-standards)
  - [Coverage](#coverage)


## Getting started

[Commits to forks]:          https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/45474
[Create repo from template]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template
[Rustmark]:                  https://crates.io/crates/rustmark

The Terracotta repository is set up as a template repository on GitHub, so that
you can easily [click the "Use this template" button to create a new repository
based on it][Create repo from template]. You can then clone your new repository
and start working on it. This will give you a starting point where you have all
the project files, but none of the commit history. This is the
currently-recommended way to start a new project using Terracotta (there are
plans to also have a command-line tool at a later date).

You may instead decide that you want to fork the repository, or clone it and
then push it to a new repository. This is also fine, but you should be aware of
the following points:

  - You will have the full commit history, which may be useful, but it is
    specifically relevant to Terracotta, and so mention of e.g. release versions
    will be misleading as your project will most likely maintain its own,
    independent versioning scheme.
  - You will also have the various release version tags created on the
    Terracotta repository, which will be misleading for the same reason, and
    likely conflict with your own tags.
  - There is no particular advantage to maintaining a Git tree association with
    Terracotta as an upstream repository, and as the development you do on your
    application will lead to conflicts, you are best not be pulling in updates
    for it. You should instead apply any Terracotta updates manually. This is
    the same as when using other web application scaffolds.
  - Forks on GitHub are treated as subsidiaries of the original repository, and
    not first-class repositories in their own right. For this reason, [commits
    made to forks don't count as contributions in user profiles][Commits to forks],
    which is not a desirable situation if you are starting a new project.

For these reasons, forking in the GitHub-recognised sense is not recommended,
and cloning and pushing to a new repository is only recommended if you are
comfortable with the caveats mentioned above.

To see an example of a project that has been created based on Terracotta, you
can look at the [Rustmark][] application. This shows how Terracotta can be used
as a starting point, and then extended to create a more complex application.
Note that in the case of Rustmark, the decision was made to actually fork
Terracotta at a stage before its initial release, as the commit history was
considered useful, and there were no release commits or tags to cause the
conflict issues mentioned above. However, after that point of inception, all
Terracotta updates have been applied manually, and it is not a "true" fork in
GitHub terms.


## Codebase structure

The code in this repository follows a simple and straightforward layout, which
is intended to be easy to understand and extend. You should absolutely modify
the file structure to suit the shape of your own web application.

The basic folder structure is:

  - `docs`: This contains documentation.
  - `html`: This is where all the HTML templates reside, to be processed by
    Tera.
  - `src`: This is where all the Rust code lives.
  - `static`: This is where any static files should go, which are public and do
    not require authentication.

The layout of each folder should be fairly self-explanatory, but it is worth
mentioning that the `src` folder represents the simplest sensible minimum. In a
proper application it is likely that the handlers should be split out into more
files, and there would also be various other supporting files too. Rather than
dictate a layout, it is left as an exercise for the reader to implement their
preferred approach.

Any images and other files that need to be protected by authentication should be
placed in the `content` directory. Public images should be placed in
`static/img`, and will be served from the `/img` URL path, similar to the CSS,
JS, and WebFont files.

All of the content and static material is included in the compiled binary,
making it very straightforward to deploy.


## API endpoint structure

Machine-consumable endpoints should be placed under a path of `/api`. Those that
have application functionality should be versioned, and placed under a path of
`/api/vX`, where `X` is the version number. For example, the first version of
the API is placed under `/api/v1`.


## API endpoint commit checklist

This section contains a checklist of things that are mandatory to do when adding
a new API endpoint.

**For each endpoint added**, the following need to also be added:

  - Rustdocs
  - Unit tests
  - OpenAPI documentation
  - Written documentation

**For each commit made**, the following need to pass without errors or warnings:

  - `cargo build`
  - `cargo clippy`
  - `cargo doc`
  - `cargo test`

**Before a new endpoint can be declared complete**:

  - A coverage report needs to be run and checked. See the [Coverage](#coverage)
    section for more details.


## Coding standards

[Coding standards]: https://github.com/danwilliams/standards-rs
[Nerd Font]:        https://www.nerdfonts.com/

The code in this repository follows some specific and opinionated [coding
standards][]. These mostly follow typical community conventions, but notable
differences are the use of tabs for indentation, the alignment of various terms
to aid readability, the use of comment headers to separate sections of code, and
the usage of [Nerd Font][] symbols in those headers to belay semantic meaning in
order to apply highlighting.

You may well dislike aspects of the coding style, which is fine â€” feel free to
change things, and make the code your own! Individuality is important.


## Coverage

[kcov]:          https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov
[rust-coverage]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/04/07/Rust-1.60.0.html#source-based-code-coverage
[Tarpaulin]:     https://crates.io/crates/cargo-tarpaulin

[Since Rust 1.60.0, coverage is supported natively][rust-coverage]. This means
that there is no need to use external tools such as [Tarpaulin][] or [kcov][] to
generate coverage reports, which is a huge improvement.

### Preparation

On a Debian or Ubuntu system, you will need to install the `grcov` package. You
will also need to install the `llvm-tools-preview` component for Rust, and
create a directory to store the coverage reports in.

```bash
sudo apt install grcov
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
mkdir coverage
```

### Running

The following commands will run the tests and generate coverage reports. The
profile files are then deleted, as they are not needed. The commands will
generate reports in HTML and LCOV formats, the latter of which can be loaded
into various tools.

Note that the `--binary-path` is important, and needs to point to your build
directory. By default this will be under `./target`, but if you have changed
this, e.g. to store builds in a central location, then you will need to adjust
the path accordingly.

```bash
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 RUSTFLAGS='-Cinstrument-coverage' LLVM_PROFILE_FILE='cargo-test-%p-%m.profraw' cargo test
grcov . --binary-path ./target/debug/deps/ -s . -t html --branch --ignore-not-existing --ignore '../*' --ignore "/*" -o coverage/html
grcov . --binary-path ./target/debug/deps/ -s . -t lcov --branch --ignore-not-existing --ignore '../*' --ignore "/*" -o coverage/tests.lcov
find . -name "*.profraw" -delete
```

### Viewing

The HTML report can be viewed by opening `coverage/html/index.html` in your
browser.
